# 🫀 ECG Heart Disease Prediction

This project analyzes ECG (Electrocardiogram) data and predicts the presence of heart disease using Machine Learning algorithms.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has heart disease based on ECG features.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature selection
- Machine Learning model training
- Model evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix)
- Prediction system

---

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## 📊 Machine Learning Model

The model is trained using classification algorithms such as:

- Logistic Regression / Random Forest (edit based on your model)
- Performance evaluated using accuracy score

---

## ▶ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ashokswathi892-svg/ecg-analysis-ml-project.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the application:
   python ecg_app.py
